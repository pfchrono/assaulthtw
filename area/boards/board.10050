If you are in the Alliance Rebirth, you get

To get a lot of QP, get all the eq that the armorer spawns, and
sell it in the market. More armorers are good too.

I have a problem with an alliance member @@aFri Dec 12 12:14:25 2003
@@N~
Kurupted is in our alliance but that is the problem he attacked and destroyed
most of my turrets of my last base I would either want an apology and/or Him out of our
alliance cause i DONT trust a person who previously attacked me and is now in our alliance.
