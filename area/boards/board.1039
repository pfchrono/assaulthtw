Internal defense has been weakened.
Turrets will only hit air targets if equipped with a specific damage type. Read "help small turret" for the short list.

a) I didn't see any rejection or anything at all that addressed my DJ suggestion on the board. I assumed you
overlooked it.
b) Everyone else wrote suggestions on the forum and not privately on the board!
And taking out 5 buildings with a bomber plane: even if you manage to pull it off, they're still replaceable,
and I never said the 6 people in my core did any noticeable damage.
Also I don't see why you have go berserk when I post my suggestions...

One thing that has bothered me about disconnected buildings is this.
 
1) Security still fires at it's normal rate.
2) Disconnected walls are just as(if not in some situations better) effective as they would be as if they were connected to the base.
 
Solution to 1 is easy. But here's an idea I had for 2. Make disconnected walls have default all exits open, much like incomplete buildings are. The exits are still marked like in incomplete buildings. So if the walls get reconnected the exits return to normal. 
 
Can this be done? Just my idea.

that was my base when Dantis, Pasik, and Vip showed up and started attacking.
 
Their justification?  I had 3 level 10 banks, with almost 25k in each of them, 2 level 6 war cannons, and I had lost my base about 6 hours earlier.  This started because I have scripting set up for building buildings at a certain level and wouldn't give it to Pasik.
Pasik had told me when he used his spy quarters on me that he would not attack me, and then the Wild Card alliance showed up and destroyed all of my 22 buildings and killed me.

Were you in newbie status?

Was your base lost less than 6 hours before?
 
I can tell you right now the answer to all of these is no. You had 98 hours, lots of money in the bank and lost your bases -12- hours before the attack.
 
You should have been good to go in terms of building defenses.

I had barely filled all the banks with 25k, which is what most people do before they start worrying about their base.  Even if I had withdrawn it all, and built defenses, it still would not have helped, because I was triple-teamed.  It had only been 6 hours since I had died last, which I believe was when I asked someone to kill me so I could change class and rebuild.  And the last time I was attacked, I was COMPLETELY destroyed, including all my money, so I had to rebuild from scratch.
 
About having the money in my banks, the money does not last when I go to build defenses.  I was doing what most people do, and that is use the money from interest to build defenses, and never had a chance to withdraw interest from the banks when they were full.
 
I remember that on HTW, there was never a problem with people attacking defenseless bases, and that is because there was a certain code of honor, and people understood what was right and wrong.  It seems that the rules, rather than restricting attackers' privileges, are giving attackers a right to attack bases that anyone would have clearly considered off-limits before.  Even Pasik admitted that he bends the rules in his favor.  Please take this into consideration.

You are now not able to build an HQ within 10 rooms of another HQ. This is to prevent cheating and having 'super bases' with ... like 5 HQs in the same place.
 
Upon death, you will only lose 1% of your highest skill, instead of all skills.
 
Selling bases is now officially illegal. You want someone's base? Capture it. Effective immediately.

I just wanted to let you know, though I will not be around NEARLY as
much, I will still drop by at least weekly. Though, I doubt I will ever play
faithfully again for a very long time. As some of you already know,
we majorly fucked up and got behind on alot of shit.. Now we are completely
screwed. So, I will be working tons in order to fix my major fuckups.
 
That aside, tis not the only reason I wont be playing.. I've played this game
for 3 years. And I dont mean off and on, I mean solid, logging 1000's apon 1000's of hours.
I mastered 2.0 and ran the show for a good long time. It was much fun and
I made tons of friends. Most noteable of such: Amnon, Wulfston, Spelguru, Deveral
Cylis, shishio, among many others. Ive had many a good time, and many a good flame
war. But, I feel like my time has passed, I dont have near the drive to suceed
in the game as I used to, nor the patience to do so. I've just lost interest.. It's
bound to happen with any game you play that often. And with the switch
to 3.0, all these things have just increased in volume. Dont get me wrong, Amnon needed
to make the change and I am quite glad he did, It just doesn't suit *me* anymore.

A big thanks and ***MAJOR PROPS*** to Amnon to actually manage to create a game
which would occupy my mind for 3 fucking years. No game ever has had that impact on me.

Not to fuss or anything, but idle people still count as being in the room they went idle in -- Normally this isn't a problem, but I attacked Solidus, and he went idle in his HQ as I was virusing. Now, about two hours later, i'm trying to log off, and I can't because it says he's in one of my buildings. He's vanished from the map, i've spied him, to make certain he's in the HQ I took, but his character isn't appearing. Thus, uh.. I'm kind of stuck. I went and demolished the minibase around it, and just thought i'd point this out. Not that I expect anything resembling a reimbursal, I just thought you'd like to know about this minor problem.

Pit idea. Make a few pits accessible by pit1 pit2 pitx commands, that have a predefined eq set given and a predefined arena with indestructible buildings like lev 5 wc and sniper nests placed (if it's possible to make an every man's wc).. possibly even assigning nuke like rules of teamplay initiation, I.e. first man in pit waits for as much as he sees fit and then types start for teams to be divided into two equals, and if teams are inequal, the smaller team gets players of higher rank, or it's just two captains selecting members in turn. This means I'm suggesting counter strike version of pit and ground zero (completely inside indestructible buildings) version of the pit. Maybe make these arenas accessible only for imm held turneys, but just saying I'd fight team fights in pit, and a lot of clam steam would be likely to go out there too.

A Tribute @@aWed Apr 13 16:21:01 2005
@@N~
We are gathered here today to honour the passing of one of Assault's finest, the legend of the earlier versions and one of the best of the new versions, Demise.  Many of you know of my legendary attacking skills.*  Most of this came from Demise's help.  I will never forget the day when I was a noob with only 30 or so hours, and Demise attacked my base.  I will never forget his words of wisdom and insight, "Kill me, noob," as he handed me an M4 (I didn't have a level 5 armory.)  This was when I learned my first lesson about fighting: how to fight.  Since then, I have improved a lot, and my goal for my next hundred hours is "learning how to win."  (Perhaps that is pushing it, some. "Learning how to not lose as much" is a more realistic goal.)
 
I have learned much more from Demise, and gained valuable experience from his attacks on my bases.  More recently, I have had the opportunity to serve as a soldier in Dominion, where my bumbling hacking skills cost us both our bases.  Umm, maybe I should leave that out.  After all, this is a tribute to Demise...
 
I was around to see Demise gain his 1000 ranks, and I have seen his statue become one of the best.  I was around when HotReboot was formed, and the best attacker, Demise, teamed up with the best defender, Wulfston, for mayhem beyond all belief.  Back in that long-lost time, everyone feared an attack by Demise, but respected the attacker himself, who is arguably one of the best attackers EVER in the game.
 
*This sentence is bull shit.  I am one of the worst attackers in the game.

Alliance banks @@aWed Apr 13 23:46:00 2005
@@N~
Myst and I developed a few ideas, but this is the only one I remember.
there should be a new building, the Alliance bank.
Players can deposit money in it and all other members of their
alliance can get the money too. Also, when a member of the
alliance buys something there should be a predetermined
amount of money deposited into the alliance account.
This would help if alliance members weren't on-line
at the same time and needed to pay eachother
or if an alliance member needed funds. It would also be
a new motive for people to join an alliance.
The alliance would have to take it into their own hands to
prevent members from squandering the resource, but
alliances do things like that anyway I think.
TY,
Mystinar and Zalethon

Also, we think that alliances should recieve increased income
from shops.
THis is what mystinar said:
" A better example to explain why alliances would get increased money from shops would be one we see in the real world. Example being a group like the Taliban. They send drugs to the U.S. And the funds would to to fund such an alliance.
Along that line, I was thinking that if Alliance Banks were put in, all sales made by anyone in any building belonging to an alliance would contribute a preset amount to the bank."
I don't really have anything to contribute to it, but I think it's a good idea.

I was thinking why noobs don't stay here. And then it hit me.
I have 135 hours and my base still isn't finished.
Imagine what a noob must feel like if his base is
demolished after 20 hours - he worked 15 hours to
get money and 5 hours to build a base, which still
isn't finished because it takes about 3 million
$ to finish a base completely. After 20 hours, his
base is demolished, he has to work another 15 hours
for cash, but this time he has no safe period, so
people would attack him anyway as soon as he has
some defenses (because they don't want to look "unhonourable")
My first base was demolished when I was at about 10 hours, and
then I started building a new one, so 125 hours and not
finishing a base sucks. Also once I finish this base, it
will probably be invincible - 2 layers of level 10 turrets,
2 layers of level 10 energy walls, all antivirused, firewalled,
level 9 security, with the best damage types on the turrets,
level 10 war cannons and a couple of sniper nests. Impenetrable
fortress. Except for the amazingly easy-to-explot weakness of
minibases. Once someone takes over my minibase, all the hard
work I put into my base is just a measure of how long it takes
for it to go down (because I can't rebuild during combat).
 
So what's the point of this?
That bases take 200 hours to build, and that although they are
invincible, minibases are extremely easy to take compared to
a base. A finished base will go down quickly like that, so
all your hard work isn't worth much. (Also if you don't have
minibases, your base won't survive much). Noobs don't stay
here because it takes forever to build a base that is easily
taken down one way or another, and they don't want to stick
around to gather money for 15 more hours and then 15 on
building a "card base". There are lots of things I want to
write so this note probably looks confusing...
In short, make base building shorter.
Make it so blaster turrets aren't 13K to upgrade from level
5 to 10, make it so players don't have to idle for 24 hours
just to gather enough money to buy all the antivirus and
firewall installations they need, make it so recon planes
can't be used to evade turret damage in order to eject over
someone's bank and arm a C4 in it, ridding the player of
30K so easily, even make it so newbies have a newbie planet
to play on, and they can "cash in" their buildings when
they feel ready to be teleported into the real world, so
they don't have to start over when they're done with the
newbie planet.
This note will probably make you angry at me... at least
I said what's on my mind

a) Since people's main reason for leaving the game was working too long on their bases then not having the guts to protect them, I've decided to ditch the whole part of base-building. Therefore, all buildings' costs were reduced by 90%, so NOBODY will EVER AGAIN have the right to whine when they lose something.
 
b) Bomb splash damage is back, and it does good damage.
 
c) Building limit has been increased
 
d) All buildings will now have metal bars equipped on their roofs. Result? If you eject a plane over them, you get staked and die. Always.
 
e) Chinooks are back, with only 1500 fuel. They will also constantly lose fuel.

Kamahl is a friend in RL, and he kpt bugging me to join.  For a brief moment we had what could have amounted to a good base together, but it all went downhill.  I let him in mainly because until I did, it was only me and you, and you were never on, at least not at the same time as me.  Nice to see you back, Adin.  Perhaps someday I will actually get a base up, but I doubt it, the way I was attacked by Wild Card only 5 minutes after I started building.  And I mean I was literally building when they came after me.  I can't stand those fuckers.  Well, talk to you later.

When I erase a note, it means it's rejected. I don't have to reply to everything everyone writes.
 
Also, your idea is VERY EXTREMELY MUCH rejected. Half the idea behind 3.0 was to make it IMPOSSIBLE for people to build minis next to someone. That was the entire point of attached buildings!
 
I don't want minis next to the person you're attacking, cause then attacks would -never- end. No point in trying to convince me otherwise.

If that were the case then fuel would have absolutely no meaning for vehicles, you could just carry around tanks of fuel and restock whenever you're low. Result? Fuel becomes a pointless variable that you can a trigger to get rid of.
 
So the answer is no.
 
Vehicles have enough fuel to get where you want to.

I would write a note (you could to) declaring war on wild card but then we'd have those newbies (novices sry they kill newbies) after us playing gang bang. Also I was thinking of trying to find out your location (IRL) and possibly talk to you in person (no long distance calls hopefully) so we can discuss some things that I shall not write on this board. I am being drowned in homework but I can try to "sneak" on at around 7:00 but don't expect me. try to post me about what times your on so we can chat on altalk. 
On the Kamahl issue, tell him Adin wants to get a note from you about your abilities what you are good at and bad at. Hacking does not count due to fact it's simple to hack with right equipment. Also I would like to know his current lab. Please Kill people to honor Bestebulzebar and wipe their blood around and on your walls. 
Adin a greater demon for Bestebulzibar
P.S. don't forget to write on your walls above the blood "here lies the blood of (blah-blah) who was killed in honor of bestebulzibar. We are encouraging him to die more for our cause.
