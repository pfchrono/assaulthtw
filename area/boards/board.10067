You all know how you don't get combat lag from off planted buildings when damaged right?
Well it seams you can get lag...if someone enters your building and triggers the security.

Are we all going to be teamed up after this big alliance change? If so, who are the other guys that should be let in the alliance, since it's kinda bad to have 1/3 of the avaible alliance just for the *counts* 5-6 of us... I'm kinda tired right now :)
 
Oh btw: mud filters are WAY below imp mines... seen chunks o 11 generate in them mines where a mud filter is 5 max...
