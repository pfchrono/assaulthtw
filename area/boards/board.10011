Rules. I had hoped we'd never need this post @@aWed Apr 13 18:49:28 2005
@@N~
now, I never even thought of it, but
please check with another member before acception someone.
I have nothing against you accepting your friends, in fact, I
support it!
I would just like it if the person being accepted had two
votes for acception :) If there is no one on, just post
a note on the board and I, or someone else (don't really mind who)
will see about accepting him/her, so long as they see fit.
Whoever has been accepted so far without two members agreeing may stay.
 
Please note that these rules apply to me as well.
They are also subject to negotiation if another member dosn't see them as fit.

Loans and things of that sort @@aSun Apr 17 00:25:51 2005
@@N~
Now that buildings and ugrades are so much cheaper, I'm willing to give more money out.
But...as the title mentions, loans are also another thing I may begin giving out. But the grants of money will only change to loans if I myself start getting low.
While the three level 10 banks I have help keep me stable in regards to money, its not as fast as I wish it would be.
So unless I hit a point of 25000 or lower, all money I give out doesn't need to be returned ever except in extreme emergencies.
If i hit that point though, I will only give money out so long as it is to be at least 50% returned within 3 days.
This doesn't count for small bits of money, anything below $1000. Anyone who can't spare that much at any given time is either a scrooge or is in dire need of money themselves. :P
I hate to sound stingy by starting this but even though I have lots of money and gain it relatively fast, I'm not a money tree.
Note:
Exceptions in regards to paying me back will be made if you yourself are recovering from something heavy, like a full base wiping by Vip and/or Dantis for example.

Central Base Area? @@aMon Apr 18 11:26:59 2005
@@N~
On the subject of government: there seems few problems, as no-one has challenged Zalethon at all and I don't think he's doing a bad job at all. Although (being one of the most experienced players in Element) we cannot jump to conclusions and so many players means we may be unstable. I'm no politician however!
On the subject of a single area of which to build bases: This has been proved an awesomely good idea (For example, WCs original site which ironically I found and insisted we use it) and I have previous experience in it... spacing bases about 10 squares apart is not against the rules, and a simple airfield network served me very well while I was in WC.
fire n am currently living in a reasonably big sand field, and invite any people who lose their bases to come and join me in teh desert. A gradual move is the best one... of course, if anyone has a better site I am in no permanent position (no defenses) and due to cheap building will gladly move.
Anywayz... it's definitely a good idea to build close. Hell, while I was in WC we held a good defense for 1 1/2 hours together. We didn't lose either, only Vip got a little bashed up :)
Peace out folks. I want this alliance to become one of the greats.

Replying to everything @@aWed Apr 20 11:49:53 2005
@@N~
On the subject to central base area (and getting whooped): Point taken. Consider a larger yet not gigantic distance however for plane travel between bases.
On the subject of government: I can see privateers point quite clearly. I think the best approach is a communism as well. If we were to do such a thing we should also consider every big event going through the board as to notify all members of current affairs, as wel as even a small poll for the long-term decisions our leader will obviously need us for every once in a while.
I've been in enough unreliable alliances, and as far as I can see Element will not fall to deceit, backstabbery and all those things that hurt the few and boost the many. If we can share our resources to those in need of more we will be proving our alliance is far more stable then the others. Stay loyal, situation is currently looking good!
Deviousduck, the semi-experienced advisor on all things evil and benig... ummm, alliance politics *hides*

Hi all! As you can tell by the title I'm moving my base. I'm moving closer to rogue's and zalethon's base so i can help them. And on the matter of the lab crisis i am making a communications lab.
