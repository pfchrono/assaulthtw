This is a brief list of what is supposed to be the alliance rules. Rule 1 is simple - for the continued membership in the alliance you have to be getting alliance points each week. For now it's a symbolic sum of 5 points, comprised of - 1 point per 1 kill, or per 4 bkills, or per 5 online hours. One nukem victory counts as 2 points. if you have 3 bkills - it counts as 0 points, if you have 4 online hours - it counts as 0 points.
Points remaining to the end of the week are halved, and rounded down to integer, and transferred to next week.
5 point rule is the test of the point system itself and if it works, will be swapped to about 15 points.
Second rule is never ever to attack anyone without the permission of senior online member online. For now it's determined by rank, and if ranks equal - online hours.
