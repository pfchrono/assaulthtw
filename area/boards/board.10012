Welcome, I would like to show my thanks for allowing me to join this alliance, and so I chose to do it like this. In the beginning of 3.0 and even 2.0 people feared the then greats. They were known to us as Demise, Wulfston, Cylis, Spelguru, Blaze, and Shishio. Well, the greats are dead now, but people still speak their names. Newbies to this game believe they have the power. Well, in their arrogant wrought ignorance we shall strike them down. As of now, it is just going to be us three. Virex, Isk, and Ghost (myself). Maybe more later on, if any prove to be compentant enough. Maybe it will stay the trio of death. Whatever happens in the future, is yet to be determined, but one thing. In the extremely near future, people are going to fear us three. We are not newbies. We have suffered attacks from all the dead greats. We have all destroyed the dead greats as well. It is our time to take our rightful stances as the backbone of Assault.
 
People are going to fear us. People are going to fear The Black Hand, because that is who we are. Let us cast down the newbies that seem to be delusional enough to feel their power is lasting simply because they have rank over us. Well, I feel it is about time the long running vets of this game have caught the newbies, and surpass them. I am tired of Dantis and Deviousduck believing they have the right to talk shit. I am tired of them putting us down as if we were in their places. Why do they do this? Simply because they have rank over us. That is all about to end.
 
Long live the trio of death. Long live The Black Hand! Glory come on the day whenever people cower at the names of Virex, Isk, and Ghost. Fear us they will, destroy them we must!
