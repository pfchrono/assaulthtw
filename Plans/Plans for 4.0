Support building?
Convert a HQ to a building with limited support (outpost blds). This halves the increase in building limit, but also deters someone from capturing needlessly. Can't transfer ownership (explain with explosives attached?)

Space: Spacestations in orbits, trading only in ultra space, but forts with "wheels". Upgrade ships to allow more capabilities. Land to take it to ground fights.

Ships can land, and do a temp base. (Deploy)

Vehicle overhaul? Passengers and "co-pilots". Some deployable vehicles... C&C style. (Board - passengers, pilot - drive) CHAR_DATA has pilot and boarded variables alread (int)

Custom vehicles, different hacking

New alliance system

Medals & Practice (Immort Arena?)
