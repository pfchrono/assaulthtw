Greetings all, and Welcome to @@RG@@We@@Rn@@Wo@@Rc@@Wi@@Rd@@We@@g!!
 
What is Genocide?
 
Genocide is The systematic and planned extermination of an entire national,
 racial, political, or ethnic group.
 
Here are the rules:-
1. Always strive to be # 1
2. Prepare well for combat, and fight well
3. Don't die too much.
 
If you suffer defeat or your base is blown, do NOT whine!

labs @@aFri Feb 13 04:25:12 2004

Another thing that might be usefull for the alliance would be to determine which labs we have and which we need
I'm a computer lab person here, L3 chip factory and programmer shack, but i intend to improve both of those greatly in the coming days and weeks, post your lab around here somewhere as well please.

I'm mining myself, have been mining forever (xept a small comp lab before space got added) and will probably stay mining forever.

Allies @@aMon Feb 16 00:57:02 2004

Allies shouldn't charge for help they give to other allies. I mean, if I was to pay for stuff from an ally just as I pay for stuff from non-allies, it would kinda remove parts of the whole being allies thing...

allies @@aMon Feb 16 05:15:40 2004
@@N~
well, not paying depends on what help, obviously if someone helps you gather alien metal in space, that means that he or she has used his/her time to help you, some compensation is obviously in place.
However when it comes to defending bases, i suppose allies are going to be defending eachother's bases without asking for things, because you help defend him this time and next time, he'll help you defend

Re: allies @@aMon Feb 16 09:45:05 2004

I can see that if someone helps ya mine for alien metal, sure, maybe some compensation is in order, but to charge stuff for the items your lab makes for free even if you aint there to invest time in it, that's just wrong. I mean, look at blaze, he was kind enough to let me camp his chip factories and programmers shack, he is like, an ideal ally. Although he could do something about the condition his base is in. The floors had 1 dustball on it!

you're completely right ofcourse spelguru, factory items that cost nothing to make should be shared freelly among alliance members
i'll be asking the newest member to build a comm lab for us, so we can get all kinds of neat comm lab things

Just to clarify, you cannot ask someone to build a comm lab for us to get the stuff, they choose whichever lab they want, if they dont wanna be comm lab its ok, as long as they get a good base and can whoop ass thats all we need.

Shaggy (insanemonky's new name) was hitting remmon pretty hard, so I told remmon to relocate to scort, he is now located about 3 rooms n of my own base
Will also relocate slayer here as well

succesfull, now fully established on Scort, slayer is still building right now but he shouldn't take much longer either.
i hope this base will last a long, long, long time with the help of the alliance
 Now everyone go and move to Scort will you?
so we can all occupy a little se corner of the map

I'd say, we gather a large group of players when he comes online, go over to his base and make sure there isn't even a pile of smouldering ashes left when we're finished, then kill him a couple of times so he has to restart completely
anybody else thinks this is a good idea?

well, if that's what's happening, just wipe him out time and time again, till he gets completely sick of the game/allies run out of resources
