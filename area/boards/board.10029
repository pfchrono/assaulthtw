Regarding to questions @@aTue Mar  9 17:07:21 2004

Well... Hierchy, Maktakk is in charge of that. Rule: Help each other, no soul-eating while in the club house (Outside it's okay, in fact encouraged)
And what else. Oh, no back stabbing. And aid whoever asked for help, even if they are not in the alliance.
And no newbiekilling. You can blow the buildings out, but not killing them. And please help them rebuild.
There will be more. *cough*

Look,i've heard many reports being made about you all attacking newbies. Bad,Mass,i don't want to hear this. If i get reports of ANYONE newbiekilling i want a good reason why you did. 
 
I don't want this happening,the point of this alliance is to protect newbies,and bring peace. Bad,keep it up and your banned. Amnon's given me reports that mostly out of all newbie attacks you lead over 50% of them. Watch who you attack,look for flags,and the colors of their bases.

Was just attacked by Corman and Osiris at the same time; a good half my base was gone by the time they left.  My base is fixed now, but I would greatly appreciate it if anyone could post Corman and Osiris's base coordinates here, respectively.
