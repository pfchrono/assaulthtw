Welcome, all members of NMSL
 
It is a great honor to have you on the team, and do know we hand-select only the BEST, FINEST men available.
 
Alright, I'm just talking out of my ass, at time of writing, it's only me and King, but who knows, one day, we will unite all of those great people under our flag.
 
Anyway, nice of you to join us if you're reading this.
 
- Cebra, at the moment Manic Miner
 
P.S. NMSL stands for Nil Mortifi Sine Lucre, which means 'no death without payment' which here will mean something like, cross us and your dead, but it originally meant we kill people for money, this quote is actually from the Discworld series of books, by Terry Pratchett (recommended reading!)
