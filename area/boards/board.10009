any time when I am on I will be happy to let you buy
psychic weapons of any kind from my base, or if you
are under attack and losing ammo I'll buy the weapons
mayself and help you, if you like.

Hi folks sorry haven't been on much, been busy.  For some reason when Kamahl quit us he decided to give me the leadership.  I wasn't when he did this so I don't know if he got you all to vote on it or not.  But in lack of knowledge I transfered the ownership of the clan to bob.  He was the second member.  I'd like to here your opinions though.
Thanks
