As of right now I must ask that nobody attack Killerking, he has also agreed not to attack anyone in this alliance.  If he does, let him know that you are in my alliance and if he does not stop, kill him on site.

I have now ordered throughout the alliance that Blog and everyone who have joined him is to die on the spot.  I do not care who they are or how new, they are to die without question.

He has betrayed me many times before already.  I wish to speak with him personally.  As of right now, I do not trust him unless he gives me a reason to trust him.
